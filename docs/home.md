## Summary

The CLA would be an open and consolidated list of persons or groups of national, historical, or cultural significance. It would be established by extracting relevant data from a series of sources (which would be mentioned), reconciling this data and making it available as a controlled vocabulary.

Its main benefit would be the establishment of a cross-institutional standard that could be further used for the development of other tools servicing the sector as a whole, rather than single institutions at once. 

This website gives an overview of what an end result might look like, but it is not representative of the substantial work necessary to achieve this. Pending the allocation of significant resources, it would currently be possible to explore the development of a pilot project.

The development of *any usable list is not feasible with current resources* and would entail, at the very least:

* A change to CHIN’s business model (including authority over data);
* A dedicated (off canada.ca) platform and/or website (beyond CCI-CHIN’s 50th anniversary);
* The establishment of production and maintenance protocols and team(s) for deployment; 
* The allocation of considerable resources in a sustained and consequential manner.
