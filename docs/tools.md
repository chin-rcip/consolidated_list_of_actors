An example of the types of tools that could potentially be developed as part of a dedicated research component.

- SPARQL Endpoint
- Open Refine API : The CLA API enables the addition of its persons and groups list to Open Refine in order to facilitate reconciliation and enrichment based on its controlled contents. This has the benefit of simplifying the data cleaning process and contributing to interoperable standards and practices across the sector. 
- DOPHEDA Collections across Canada: Using Statistic Canada’s [Open Database for Cultural and Arts Facilities](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020014-eng.htm), this application generates statistics and visualizations on the geographical location of institutions in Canada, and on the different actors whose production is collected in each. 
- DOPHEDA Relationships: Using DOPHEDA’s Actors Model, this tool visualizes the relationships between actors from the CLA list. 
- DOPHEDA Statistics : Using DOPHEDA’s Actors model, this tool generates statistics on the information found in the CLA (e.g. gender representation in collections, median age of creators, etc.).
- Data visualization
