## Summary

The CLA would be an open and consolidated list of persons or groups of national, historical, or cultural significance. It would be established by extracting relevant data from a series of sources (which would be mentioned), reconciling this data and making it available as a controlled vocabulary.

Its main benefit would be the establishment of a cross-institutional standard that could be further used for the development of other tools servicing the sector as a whole, rather than single institutions at once.

This website gives an overview of what an end result might look like, but it is not representative of the substantial work necessary to achieve this. Pending the allocation of significant resources, it would currently be possible to explore the development of a pilot project.

The development of *any usable list is not feasible with current resources* and would entail, at the very least:

* A change to CHIN’s business model (including authority over data);
* A dedicated (off canada.ca) platform and/or website (beyond CCI-CHIN’s 50th anniversary);
* The establishment of production and maintenance infrastructure, protocols, and team(s) for deployment; 
* The allocation of considerable resources in a sustained and consequential manner. 

## Questions

* Who determines who is of national, historical, or cultural significance? Authoritative contributors such as museums and galleries could submit entries without CHIN questioning their validity, but other sources will have to be vetted by CHIN who will also be in charge of reconciliation. This entails a change to the current business model: currently, CHIN is hosting data whose authority over is always outside its purview; a controlled list would involve a list over which CHIN would have authority, including who does and does not qualify (based on a governance framework that is yet to be established; for example, relevance could be assessed through a list of references having to be provided at the time of submission). 
* Who at CHIN (currently or not) would be in charge of the list, of the vetting process of new entities, and of publication (i.e. beyond putting in place the infrastructure, who will manage contents and maintain the list in the long run)?
* This amounts to creating and managing a custom, centralized vocabulary (the CLA) that will be useful to the Target Model. In this context, there will likely be an expectation from the heritage community that CHIN will endorse the management of more than one relevant vocabulary: is this something CHIN is prepared to and/or capable to do?
* Can CHIN reuse data it is currently hosting as long as it is factual (i.e. list of public actors names, dates of birth and death, occupations and parents, siblings, and children when they are also relevant)? Are there data sources CHIN cannot use?
* Per data sovereignty principles and recent treaty agreements, can and/or should data about Indigenous peoples  (provided they have agreed to its diffusion) or any other sensitive data include mention of communities? What other concerns must be examined (e.g. identifying and shadowing data)?
* What governance structure would stakeholders be willing to consider? 
* Is there a willingness to renew and/or adapt agreements?
* How will resources be secured for the project? How long is necessary to determine what funding is possible, how sustainable it will be, and when it will be available?
* Must everything be done in-house at PCH? What funding and resources structures are available and should be considered (e.g. contracting external firms, developing expertise, etc.)?
